# Mongo Example

This repository is originally based on [Transform MongoDB collections automagically into Graphs](https://medium.com/neo4j/transform-mongodb-collections-automagically-into-graphs-9ea085d6e3ef)

It spins up a MongoDB instance with a pre-loaded twitter dataset and an empty Neo4j database. You can get both systems started, by running the following commands:


```
git clone git@github.com:neo4j-examples/mongo-example.git
cd mongo-example
docker-compose up
```
